## About the Video 
Welcome to this comprehensive course on ethical hacking! This course is focused on the practical side of penetration testing without neglecting the theory behind each attack. Before jumping into penetration testing, you will first learn how to set up a lab and install needed software to practice penetration testing on your own machine. All the attacks explained in this course are launched against real devices in Zaid's lab. The course is structured in a way that will take you through the basics of Linux, computer systems, networks, and how devices communicate with each other. We will start by talking about how we can exploit these systems to carry out a number of powerful attacks. This course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level  and by the time you finish, you will have knowledge about most penetration testing fields. You will also learn how to discover and exploit a number of dangerous vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, XSS vulnerabilities, and so on. At the end of each section you will learn how to detect, prevent and secure your system and yourself from these attacks. All the attacks in this course are practical attacks that work against any computer device,  so it does not matter if the device is a phone, tablet, laptop, or whatever. Each attack is explained in a simple way: first you will learn the theory behind each attack and then you will learn how to carry out the attack using Kali Linux.
